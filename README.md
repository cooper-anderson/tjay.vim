# tjay.vim

Modified version of [josuegaleas/jay](https://github.com/josuegaleas/jay)

It is called `tjay` because I had trouble finding a good colorscheme that has colors that work for me both in normal vim and in tmux. Then I found `jay` and it worked well and the colors were pretty close so I modified a couple and changed some highlighting around.
